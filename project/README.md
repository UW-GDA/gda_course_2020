# Geospatial Data Analysis Final Project

## Overview
The final project is an essential component of this course. It provides an opportunity for you to independently scope and explore a topic of interest, and hopefully apply some of the concepts and approaches that we've covered during the course, solidifying your understanding of the material. The hope is that you can share what you learned with your classmates, and then proudly post your final project repository on your Github page to share with the world (and future employers).

## Expectations, Deliverables, and Milestones
### Weeks 1-3: Defining a project
If you already have an idea for a project, great! If not, also great!

There is intentionally a lot of flexibility here. This can be an individual or group project, though I encourage you to consider a group project, as you can do more collectively, and it will provide real-world experience with collaborative development on Github. 

You have multiple options:
1. Propose a research question or a new tool/package, develop a plan (hopefully applying the concepts we’ve covered in class) and do the development, analysis, and interpretation
    * If you’re already engaged in independent research, try to define a project that will help you move that work forward
    * Explore a side project unrelated to your current research - you never know, it could become a viable research project in the future
    * If independent research is new to you, I encourage you to talk to me, and talk to other professors and grad students in your discipline to define a suitable final project
2. Join forces with others in the class who have already done #1.
3. Something that doesn’t fit into the above categories - pitch it!

### Week 3: Project Idea Pitches
* Develop a short, 1-minute pitch/summary of project idea(s)
* Come to class ready to share your idea(s) in small groups
* Send your summary to the instructor on Slack
    * Instructor will provide feedback
    * Instructor will compile a list and attempt to facilitate group formation around similar project ideas

### Week 6: Repo and Project Outline 
#### Create a Github repository
Create a new private repo for your project within the GDA organization (can move to personal accounts later). Try to think of a descriptive repo name, bonus points if it is clever - try to avoid repo names like “finalproject”, which doesn’t help your classmates distinguish between projects.

When you initialize, select to include a README.md and include a .gitignore for Python.

Don’t stress too much about the specifics of the repo - these are not permanent, and you can always change repo names, or start over entirely (just copy and add existing files in the first commit). One of the goals here is to gain more experience using git (potentially for collaborative work), and you’re inevitably going to make some mistakes along the way.

If you’ve decided to do a group project, pick someone to initiate and manage the repo, add each other as collaborators, and make sure all can access and commit to the repo. Send me with a direct message on Slack (including everyone on the project), so I can help make sure all of the permissions are set up correctly. 

#### Prepare your README
The README.md file in your new repo will serve as the landing page for your project. You can continue to update as your project evolves, but for now, please prepare a basic project outline. I recommend that you review the markdown cheat sheet and use some basic headings, bulleted/numbered lists, and other formatting to organize your outline.

Please include the following (can combine and reorganize as necessary):
- Project Title
- Name(s) of individual or team members
- Short 1-2 sentence summary
- Some introductory background information
- Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
- Datasets you will use (with links, if available)
- Tools/packages you’ll use (with links)
- Planned methodology/approach
- Expected outcomes
- Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
- References

That may sound like a lot, but some of these items should only be 1-2 sentences, others can be short lists. Consider this the start of your final report.

### Weeks 7-10: Do the project!
* Start early!
* Create subdirectories in your repo to store notebooks, data (if applicable), doc (for any additional documentation), etc.
* Add notebooks, code, markdown files, etc. in your new repo.
    * Don’t add huge files (files >20 MB usually don't belong in a Github repo)
    * You can store large files on the Jupyterhub, or even better, host externally and fetch dynamically for analysis
    * We'll discuss some options during labs later in the quarter
* commit early, commit often

### Final Exam Week: Presentations
* Each individual/group will prepare and deliver a ~5-10 minute presentation/demo during a group session at the eScience Institute
    * If you only need 5 minutes, that’s perfectly acceptable
    * Larger groups will have up to 15 minutes if necessary
    * Format is flexible: can be slides, scrolling through notebook(s), scrolling through markdown files
* There will be short Q&A/discussion after each presentation
    * I expect active engagement from the entire class. Part of your final project grade is based on participation during the group session.
* If using slides, please include a copy of your presentation in your final project repo (ideally a pdf, which will render on Github)
* Optional (but strongly recommended): Enable read access for the GDA student team in the Github org, so others can see your great work, and learn from what you've done!

#### Some Perspective

Please remember that nobody is asking for or expecting perfection on your final projects. The reality is that you probably only had time to attempt 10-30% of the things you outlined during Week 6. And that’s OK. If some things worked out, fantastic! Tell us a little about them so we can share your success and learn from what you’ve done. If nothing worked out, that’s also OK! Share a bit of why you chose this project, what you attempted, some of the challenges you encountered, and plans/recommendations for future work.

This was meant to be an exercise to get you independently scoping your own projects and starting to explore new data/techniques, while also solidifying and building on some of the material we covered this quarter. Nobody is expecting a research project that is ready for publication or a presentation ready for a major international conference.

If after this week, you never revisit this work, I hope that it was a useful learning experience. However, I think several of you will continue to pursue some of the things you started, maybe for your MS/PhD research, which is always really rewarding for me to see.

Also, you all know each other by now, and you know that this is a friendly, open group. Nobody is judging you or your presentation. Let’s support each other and celebrate our collective accomplishments.

### Final Exam Week: Repo Submission
* Finalize your repository with notebooks, scripts and documentation
    * Can use README, notebooks, or separate markdown to summarize methods, results, conclusions, lessons learned and future work
* Submit the Github url for your final project repo on Canvas before midnight on Friday of final exam week

## Sample project ideas
Please review several examples from previous years in the UW GDA Github organization.

Can also search the web for public datasets. Here are some examples for Seattle and federal data sources:
