# Student Initial Setup

1. We will use Slack for most communication and discussion. Please sign up for the course workspace here (using your UW email address): 
    * If you are unfamiliar with Slack, see intro material here: https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members
    * I recommend that you use the standalone desktop app rather than the web interface
1. Please create a Github account if you do not have one already: https://github.com/join
    * Send me a direct slack message with your github username (do this as soon as possible)
    * We will be using a Github organization (https://github.com/UW-GDA) and I will distribute materials/assignments using Github Classroom.
    * If all of this is new, don’t worry, we will walk through basic workflows during the first course, and you will become more familiar in the coming weeks.
    * I recommend you apply for the free edu account upgrade (https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new), which will allow you to create unlimited number of private repos with unlimited collaborators.
1. If you have not already done so, please sign up for an institutional Google account using your UW email address.  I will use Google Docs for some material and Google Drive for some data distribution, and I will only enable access for UW Google accounts (not personal accounts).
